# 𝜁📝 zetablog.io

This is the source code for [zetablog.io](https://zetablog.io), my personal blog and website.

## Running

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

To compile ReScript code to JavaScript, run

```bash
bun res:build
```

or to watch for changes

```bash
bun res:dev
```

To run the development server, run

```bash
bun dev
```

and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
